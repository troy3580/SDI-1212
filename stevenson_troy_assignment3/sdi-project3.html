<p>So this week I went with a video game/comic adventure kinda story.  Superman is going to fight some bad guys.  Doomsday, Lex, and General Zod.  They have some crazy plane to get him to a secret cave located far below the surface and they think they might defeat him.  You'll just have to run the code and find out. </p>
